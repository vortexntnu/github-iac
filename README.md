## Goal

As we continue to develop more and more workflows, some workflows might already exsist in some repo or a workflow is needed in several repos. The goal with this repository is to create a bot to manage all workflows, you state what workflow you need in the config.yaml file and the bot copies that workflow from the workflows folder to your repository.

## Config
